<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">The</span> wind had blown away the rain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all day long had soaked the level plain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the horizon’s fiery wrack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sheds loomed black.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And higher, in their tumultuous concourse met,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The streaming clouds, shot-riddled banners, wet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the flickering storm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drifted and smouldered, warm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With flashes sent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the lower firmament.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they concealed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They only here and there through rifts revealed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hidden sanctuary of fire and light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A city of chrysolite.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We looked and laughed and wondered, and I said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That orange sea, those oriflammes outspread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were like the fanciful imaginings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the young painter flings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the canvas bold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as the sage and the old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make mock at, saying it could never be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you assented also, laughingly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wondered what they meant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That flaming firmament,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_012" id="page_012"></a>{12}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those clouds so grey so gold, so wet so warm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So much of glory and so much of storm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The end of the world, or the end<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the war&mdash;remoter still to me and you, my friend.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Alas! it meant not this, it meant not that:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It meant that now the last time you and I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should look at the golden sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the dark fields large and flat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smell the evening weather,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laugh and talk and wonder both together.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The last, last time. We nevermore should meet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In France or London street,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or fields of home. The desolated space<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of life shall nevermore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be what it was before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No one shall take your place.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No other face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can fill that empty frame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is no answer when we call your name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We cannot hear your step upon the stair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We turn to speak and find a vacant chair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Something is broken which we cannot mend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God has done more than take away a friend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In taking you; for all that we have left<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is bruised and irremediably bereft.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is none like you. Yet not that alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do we bemoan;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_013" id="page_013"></a>{13}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But this; that you were greater than the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And better than the best.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O liberal heart fast-rooted to the soil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O lover of ancient freedom and proud toil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Friend of the gipsies and all wandering song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The forest’s nursling and the favoured child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of woodlands wild&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O brother to the birds and all things free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Captain of liberty!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in your heart the restless seed was sown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vagrant spirit fretted in your feet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We wondered could you tarry long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brook for long the cramping street,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or would you one day sail for shores unknown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shake from you the dust of towns, and spurn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crowded market-place&mdash;and not return?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You found a sterner guide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You heard the guns. Then, to their distant fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your dreams were laid aside;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on that day, you cast your heart’s desire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon a burning pyre;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You gave your service to the exalted need,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until at last from bondage freed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At liberty to serve as you loved best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You chose the noblest way. God did the rest.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So when the spring of the world shall shrive our stain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After the winter of war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the poor world awakes to peace once more,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_014" id="page_014"></a>{14}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">After such night of ravage and of rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You shall not come again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You shall not come to taste the old Spring weather,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To gallop through the soft untrampled heather,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bathe and bake your body on the grass.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We shall be there, alas!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not with you. When Spring shall wake the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quicken the scarred fields to the new birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our grief shall grow. For what can Spring renew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More fiercely for us than the need of you?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That night I dreamt they sent for me and said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That you were missing, “missing, missing&mdash;dead”:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cried when in the morning I awoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the world seemed shrouded in a cloak;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when I saw the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And knew another day had just begun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I brushed the dream away, and quite forgot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nightmare’s ugly blot.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So was the dream forgot. The dream came true.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the night I knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That you had flown away into the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forever. Then I cheated my despair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That you were safe&mdash;or wounded&mdash;but not dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! I knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which was the false and true.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And after days of watching, days of lead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There came the certain news that you were dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_015" id="page_015"></a>{15}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">You had died fighting, fighting against odds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as in war the gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Æthereal dared when all the world was young;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such fighting as blind Homer never sung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor Hector nor Achilles never knew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High in the empty blue.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">High, high, above the clouds, against the setting sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fight was fought, and your great task was done.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of all your brave adventures this the last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bravest was and best;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meet ending to a long embattled past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This swift, triumphant, fatal quest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crowned with the wreath that never perisheth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And diadem of honourable death;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swift Death aflame with offering supreme<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mighty sacrifice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than all mortal dream;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A soaring death, and near to Heaven’s gate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the very walls of Paradise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surely with soul elate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You heard the destined bullet as you flew,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">God, Who had made you valiant, strong and swift,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And maimed you with a bullet long ago,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cleft your riotous ardour with a rift,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And checked your youth’s tumultuous overflow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave back your youth to you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And packed in moments rare and few<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Achievements manifold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And happiness untold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bade you spring to Death as to a bride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In manhood’s ripeness, power and pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on your sandals the strong wings of youth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He let you leave a name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shine on the entablatures of truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forever:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sound forever in answering halls of fame.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For you soared onwards to that world which rags<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Concealed; you reached the walls of chrysolite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mansions white;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And losing all, you gained the civic crown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that eternal town,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of the bright commonwealth ablaze beyond our ken.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_017" id="page_017"></a>{17}</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Surely you found companions meet for you<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Those you had never known, but whom you knew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knights of the Table Round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the very brave, the very true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With chivalry crowned;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The captains rare,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Those who had loved and suffered overmuch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now free from the world’s touch.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with them were the friends of yesterday,<br /></span>

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
